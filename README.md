# Ada
Sample Ada programs.
* Quizz: a simple console mental addition "game". I thought it was fun when I wrote it as I was trying to become better at calculating stuffs in my head.
* Fibonacci: calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 20 numbers.
* Fizzbuzz: obviously a fizzbuzz program.
* Projeteuler: a few exercises I did on Project Euler years ago. It may or may not still be the correct solutions to those exercises. I still thought it could be useful to upload there for people learning Ada.
* Craps: a simple game of craps as a solution for a programming exercise on Openclassrooms. I do not play craps, thus it might not be exactly good, but it does work.
* Find That Number: another simple game where you guess a number.
